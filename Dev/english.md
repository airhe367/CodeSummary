--------------------------------------------

1.	应不应该鼓励小孩做体育运动
I believe that everyone should encourage the children to do sports every day. 
Doing sports can make them stronger especially when the children are growing. 
The only concern is that how long we should encourage them to do so. 
My opinion is to encourage the children to have at least 1 hour outdoor sports. This is very important for their health.
2.	应不应该家长辅导小孩做作业
My view is that the parents should help their children do their homework before they could really do it by themselves. 
I believe most of the children don’t know how to study by themselves before grade 2 of the primary school, 
it will easily lead them to be confused and upset at studying without parents’ help.
In these 2 years, the parents should also teach them how to finish the homework by themselves.

3.	小孩间争吵或打架，该如何处理？
In my opinion. If I encounter such a situation that children are arguing or fighting, 
I will persuade them to stop doing so, and ask them what their conflict is, then help them to analyze who is right 
or who is responsible for this conflict. Also I will tell them that arguing or fighting is really a wrong way 
to handle with people’s problem, sometimes it will lead friendship breakable.
4.	孩子放学后该不该有休闲时光
My view is that children should have their leisure time, it is important and essential [ɪˈsenʃəl] to their mental health.
But it doesn’t mean that they can play as long as they wish. Parents should tell them firstly to finish their homework.
And after doing their homework they can have their leisure time for 1 hour or 2 hours.
The right time to relax can help your child recover from the tiredness of a day's study.
5.	家长应该为孩子选择要修的课还是孩子自己选择。
In my opinion. I think it depends a lot from children to children and age by age. 
Normally children at 5 to 8 years old don’t know how to manage their interest, so parents should help to choose for their children 
But children between 9 to 12 years old generally have their own ideas about what they like. 
This time parents can only help to guide children to choose the one, but can’t choose it for them.
6.	什么运动适合家人小孩一起玩
In my opinion, I think there are a lot of choices we can choose, there are so many enjoyable activities 
that are good for both children and adults. For example, camping with your family on a beautiful riverside, 
doing a hiking around a mountain, or doing sports at a gym. 
But I would prefer to take a walk along a mountain with my family, it can bring us to smell the fresh air, a
nd also it can help us to build a strong body.
7.	该不该让小孩做家务.
My view is that everyone including the children in the family should do housework. As a member of the family, 
when the children grow up to 5 years old, they should learn to take their responsibilities. 
They can do some easy work for their parents, such as cleaning their own house, washing the dishes, or watering the plants. 
It helps them to feel the pleasure of helping others, and it can help them to generate a healthy mental world 
to know the responsibility that they should take.

8.	你觉得孩子在家帮忙打扫卫生需要给他付钱吗？ 为什么？
Well, I think it is a good question that I have never thought that before, but I suggest parents should definitely never 
pay the children to work in the house. They are also members of the family. They should take responsibility to do housework, 
everything involves money means a deal ,it is harmful to the family relationship. 
So don’t give children money as a reward for doing housework.
9.	家长是否需要介入小孩读什么类型的书？
In my opinion, children should be allowed to choose the books they like to read. But as parents, 
we should guide and monitor whether the book they choose are appropriate [əˈprəʊprɪɪt].
There are the following reasons: First, interest is the best teacher, children will be happy to read books of their choice
Second, The child's judgment is weak, they may choose a book that is not suitable for them now. Parents should give guidance.
Third, as a child grows older and older, his choice will become greater.
10.	是否支持小孩玩电脑
In my opinion, We all know that computer knowledge is very important, so the children should learn to use the computer .
I’ll give the following reasons:
First, children can use computers for online lessons in the current pandemic scenario [sɪˈnɑːrɪˌəʊ].they need to use the computer.
Second, we need to encourage children to learn new technologies, such as computer technology, network technology.
But we need to prevent children from playing computer games. 
Because children playing computer games for a long time will damage their health. .
11.	你对小孩报兴趣班咋看钢琴啊、舞蹈啊 等等
In my opinion, I will encourage my children to take their interest classes such as playing piano and dancing. 
The reason is that the children should have their own interests, Children’s world should not be boring, 
if they take interest classes, they can make friends with the same interests, the children will make many good friends.
In addition, the arts can inspire creativity and beauty in children.. 
12.	家长应该限制孩子看电脑或者用电脑的时间吗？
In my opinion, we should limit the time your children spend on using the computer. There are the following reasons:
First, children’s self-control is not strong, they are easy to indulge [ɪnˈdʌldʒ] in games, which will impact their normal life and study.
Secondly, using the computer for a long time will damage your child's eyesight, which is very important.
Thirdly, children should be guided to communicate more face-to-face with friends or family members to improve their social skills.
13.	和30年前相比，供养小孩困难还是简单了？
In my opinion. Now days, It's more difficult to breed a child than it was 30 years ago. I will give the following reasons:
First, it will cost a family more money to breed a child than ever before, the environment now is more complex than it was 30 years ago, Second, with the development of science and technology, children need to learn more and more knowledge classes, 
so it’s harder to breed a child than 30 years ago .
14.	该不该跟邻居借钱
My view is that in some cases, we could borrow small money from our neighbor if there is some emergency happening. 
For example you need to pay for the express or fast food when you forget to bring your wallet.
 But you should not borrow a big amount of money from the neighbor because they might refuse you and this will also impact your relationship with them.
15.	是否喜欢在安静环境下学习
My view is that I will love to study in a quiet environment, I can be more concentrate on studying 
and The learning efficiency is high. I don’t like other people to interrupt me while I am studying. 
But if it is not allowed, I will not stop studying when I am in a noisy environment, I will try to wear a Silent headset if possible. 
16.	电脑的使用让生活变得更简单还是更复杂
My view is that the computer has made life much easier. The live example is that I am now using the computer 
to have an English Exam. The computer is an efficient tool to help human to improve their productivity. 
It almost has involved in any areas of our daily life. 
Without computer you can even not easy to introduce your product to your customer. So the computer makes life much easier.
17.	喜欢通过收音机获取新闻还是读报纸
In my opinion, It just depends on the situations, I like to listen to the radio when I am driving a car. 
And I like to read the newspaper in the weekend. Both radio and newspaper are the main information source. 
Now days, I prefer to use my mobile phone to read the latest news. As it is up to date and more efficient and environmental.
18.	我是喜欢用什么看书
Sometimes I use my mobile phone or Huawei Pad to read the electric books, and sometimes I will buy some examination books 
from Taobao or some other web applications. Reading electric books from mechanical tools can give us the latest news 
or information, but reading examination books from a true book can make us more concentrate and efficient. 
Above all, they are both useful to me.
19.	怎么样度过假期
In my opinion, I will like to spend my holiday with my family. The best plan is to find a good hotel near the sea 
and spend a whole day in it. After a good breakfast, I can play the tennis with my kids or swim with my kids.
And when it turn dark, I can walk along the beach with my family and enjoy the silence of the nature at night.
It's a great way to relax.
20.	一个对快餐的看法
My view on fast food is: when I am busy and don’t have enough time to prepare for food by myself, 
I will choose fast food, because it could save much time when my time is really tight. But if I’m free, 
I will choose to go to a restaurant or cook by myself. Although fast food can save a lot of time for us,
 but it still isn’t a healthy life style.
21.	一个计算机和农业专业，你选哪个
In my opinion, I will choose the computer science and I already did it. The reason is that computer science used in all industries, and the students who graduate from computer science could have more job salary. 
I am also interested in the latest technology. But that doesn't mean that agricultural technology isn't important.
It's just a personal hobby. and I choose computer science.
22.	你认为最重要的是什么技术,主要是电脑手机方面的
In my opinion, I believe artificial intelligence is the most important technology in the future, 
it could help human in speeding up the productivity. Most of the handy work can be done by AI, 
it can help policeman quickly find suspicious man through cameras with this technology, 
and humans can be concentrate in some other areas.
23.	国际会展，介绍自己国家的那些东西给大家， 为什么？
Well, if I have an opportunity to present my country for another nations, I would like to present how the high-tech is in china.
For example we only need a cellphone to go anywhere you want. You can use cellphone to pay, to oriented, to buy something, 
to order the foods or even call the taxi for yourself. 
24.	你觉得学艺术或者音乐是好的教育的重要部门吗？
In my opinion, I think the learning about art or music is necessary part of good education.. 
I agree that art and music is very important to our daily life, it can teach us how to enjoy the beauty of the nature.
Also, a lot of design work requires a good artistic foundation, and people need to enjoy themselves to relax after work.
So I think art and music is definitely a necessary part of good education.
25.	你会听别人的建议还是自己亲身经历中学习？
In my opinion, I think it depends on different situations, and there isn’t an exact answer for it. 
For example if I am learning new things from a strange field, I will have some difficulties that I cannot solve by myself, 
that way, I would like some experienced people can teach me how to do it. we can master new technologies faster to get the job done.
But when people around me are all busy, I don’t want to make any inconvenience to them, this time I will learn by myself.
26.	你比较喜欢手机通话还是写信？ 
For me, there isn’t an exact answer for it. I think it depends on different situations, I love both. 
In daily communications with friends or colleagues, I would prefer to call or text a message with my cellphone.
But in a special situation such as writing a love letter to my wife or sending a card to my family,
I would prefer to write a letter with my hand. This is more special for me. 
27.	如何跟朋友维护自己的立场，如果对方持有不同意见。
Well, for me, if my friend do not agree with me about an important issue, and this issue could impact our relationship a lot, 
I'll  take his advice from friend. and then find a reasonable method between I and my friend to solve this problem.This will protect our friendship. I think this is a good way to solve this problem.
28.	你喜欢真实的故事还是编编写的故事？
In my opinion, I would like both types of stories. I like to watch stories, 
a truth story about real people who actually lived can teach me a lesson of life based on their life experience. 
Stories about made up peoples and events are more ideal, fictions is made up for entertainment occasions, 
but this type of story sometimes can give people encouragement, and I also like watch the movies or series which are made up by directors.
29.	喜欢独立工作还是小组，为什么？
In my opinion, I think it depends on different situations, 
When there is an easy work that I can handle it, I prefer to finish it by myself. But when we need to do an important project at work, and it needs many roles to join in, you need to work together with other peoples, so I think it is very important to work together and to make a good relationship with other peoples.
30.	什么设备对你最重要？
In my opinion, I think the mobile phone is the most important thing to me right now. because now we are living in a modern generation. 
mobile phone are deep into our lives. Such as, getting news, buying goods, keeping communicating with family, even to order meals every day, mobile phones have made our lives easy. And without a mobile phone, we may get lost in a big city. So I think the mobile phone is very important to me..
31.	自学更简单点还是别人教你更简单点？
Do you think that is easily for you to learn new subject by yourself or do you think it is better to have a teacher help you with a new subject, please explain.
Well, in my opinion, I think everyone should have a teacher in the beginning when you are learning a new subject, because it is difficult to make a good start as a beginner, when someone teaches you, it will lead a good result. But it is not very easy to have someone teach  word by word, most time you need to learn by yourself.
32.	你认为哪个地方最容易养家，为什么？
Well, in my opinion, I think it is deeply related to the situations of the city where you live in. 
For example, in general, if you are living in a developed city you may have more support from the state, and you can get more job to raise your family, like in Shanghai. If you are living a developing country, you may live with more difficulty, there is less support from the state and low payments for jobs that makes it difficult to support a family. 
33.	如果给青少年讲座  你想讲什么
In my opinion, if I have that big honor to give speech for teenagers, I would like to advise them to do the things which they really like,
Because the interest is the best teacher. In addition, I will tell them that AI is the hottest technology today, 
and will give the directions that they can go in the future, even the course they can take when they are going to the university.
Also I'll also tell them about my college experience. 
34.	如果有家工厂健在你家旁边，这将如何影响你的生活。
I never have been in such a situation, but if I am involved in this situation, 
I would like to know firstly which kind of this factory is, and if they will make some environmental pollution or noise pollution. It will be very dangerous for human life and health, I will not support it to build such a factory, or I will move to another place. 
35.	你喜欢传统的正装还是舒服点的便装 why? 
I don’t have too many dressing rules, I wear whatever I feel comfortable. I love to wear casual clothes rather than formal. I would much rather be in a jacket than in a suit. I’m a t-shirt and jeans type of boy. Although I’m trying to get away from that somewhat, I still find it’s easy to move with.
36.	哪类课程会让你学到更多东西，音乐还是做饭？为何会选择这门课程呢？
I think music and cooking are both useful in our daily life. Music can make us feel comfortable after a hard work, and cooking can let us do some delicious food for our families. But if I must choose one, I would like to choose cooking lessons, because my cooking ability is poor, when I’m free I don’t know how to make a delicious dinner, so now I always take fast food instead, but fast food is not healthy. I will happily cook dinner for my families.
37.	朋友或家人来做客，你会带对方去饭店还是选择在家做饭？
If my friend or a family member visit me, I would prefer to take him to a  restaurant in this area. Because my cooking ability is really very poor, I can’t make any delicious food for him, and eating at a restaurant can give us more time to talk with each other, the progress of making food at home really takes much time.
38.	描述一件对家庭比较重大的事情或者节日。
In my opinion, the wedding day is a special day for our family to celebrate.
Ten years ago, my wife and I started to live together and we got married and formed this family, and then we had 2 kids. 
On this special day, I usually choose a gift for my wife on that day, and invite my family to a restaurant outside for the dinner. 
The wedding day is a very happy day to me
39.幸福的家庭有什么特征。
In my opinion, happy family has these characteristics [ˌkærɪktə'rɪstɪk], family members are very humorous, 
the home is full of laughter, they respect to each other and treat people warmly, 
when you get along with them, you will also feel the warmth of the family.
Also , all the members of the family keep connecting if they are in different cities.
so I think these are the characteristics [ˌkærɪktə'rɪstɪk] of a happy family.

For example if I am learning new things from a strange field, I will have some difficulties that I cannot solve by myself,

or sending a gratitude card to my family, I would prefer to write a letter with my hand. This is more special for me.

a truth story about real people who actually lived can teach me a lesson of life based on their life experience.

36.	哪类课程会让你学到更多东西，音乐还是做饭？为何会选择这门课程呢？Which kind of class do you think you will learn more from, Relaxing music or relaxing cooking ，Why would you benefit from such a lesson.
Actually, music and cooking are both useful in our daily life. Music can make us feel comfortable after a tedious work, and cooking can let us do some delicious food for our families. But if I must choose one, I would like to choose cooking lessons, because my cooking ability is poor, when I’m free I don’t know how to make a delicious dinner, so now I always take fast food instead, but fast food is not healthy. So if my cooking ability is enhanced, I will happily cook dinner for my families.
