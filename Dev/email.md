Dear David,
I am writing to you because I want to discuss with you about the delivery date of goods to customer XXX. I think we could deliver the goods to customer XXX on time based on following considerations:

Secondly, I have already made a delivery plan in details based on which I have concluded that there will be enough time for us to deliver the goods.
Finally, there are many suppliers who will support us to finish the delivery.
Therefore, there won’t be any worry about the delivery of goods to customer XXX.
Should you have any concern please feel free to contact me.

2、海外采购了一批电脑，比本地的贵，给领导写理由，服务，售后，保障三点
Dear Mr. XXXX,
I am writing to you because I would like to explain why we purchased these laptops from oversea market, although it is expensive than local market. There are following three reasons:
Firstly, oversea supplier can provide us more and better services, such as 7*24 service online.
Secondly, we have collected and analyzed some feedbacks from other users. It is concluded that in most of cases, the local vendors could not meet the SLA of agreed service.
Last but not least, the quality of laptops from oversea market is much better than from local market.
In summary, we have compared the oversea service to the local one in various dimensions and finally concluded that the oversea laptops is much better.
Should you have any further question please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
William
